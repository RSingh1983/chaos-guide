Recommended Scenarios
Recommended Scenarios are pre-configured Scenarios created to test real-world failure modes, or to use as examples to customize to your needs.

Running a Recommended Scenario
To run a Recommended Scenario, select “Add Targets and Run” from the Recommended Scenario’s details page, select the targets to attack, and select “Run Scenario”.
When adding targets to the Scenario, it adds the same tag selection to each of the attacks in the Scenario.

Customizing a Recommended Scenario
To customize and run a Recommended Scenario, select the Scenario you want to run, and select “Customize”.
You can also select “Add Targets and Run” from the Recommended Scenario’s details page, and select “Customize” on the targeting slide-out.

Scheduling Scenarios
Scenarios can be scheduled to run randomly within a timeframe.
A Scenario will run at least once on the day and in the time window you select. The time window the Scenario runs can also be set.
